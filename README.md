# cartoon-ify Tool
 This project proposes a tool for converting images to cartoons that uses python libraries such as scikit-image, OpenCV, and others to segment the input image using k-means clustering.

## Description of code
- The code has 2 sections (Implentation and Testing)
- section 1 : This code contains 3 methods (edge mask creation, K-means clustering and cartoon-ify method)
- Section 2: test the implemented code using 8 images in the folder (Images)
